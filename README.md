## Really, another 2D Runner!?

I whipped up this game real quick as a learning exercise with developing a Unity game/application for Mobile.

The workflow isn't really much different at all from a desktop Unity application.

The only glaring difference really is having to be a bit more considerate with optimization since there is a wide band of performance capabilities with mobile devices.

Some devices have plenty of RAM and cpu cycles to work with (like the latest flagship Android or iOS device), while other devices are more limited in their overall horsepower.

### How To Play

Download the Forest Runner APK from the Releases section and make sure to enable **Allow Unknown Sources** on your device to install and run the APK.

Tap your phone screen to jump and see how long you can last without hitting a tree!

The game will automatically restart 2-3 seconds after dying.

Enjoy!
